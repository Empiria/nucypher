# Code Review Prompt

Please conduct a thorough code review of the provided codebase, evaluating
it against established best practices for software engineering in general and
Python specific coding principles.

Place the results into a file named review.md in the same directory as this
prompt.

## Review Criteria

It's important that you examine, review and report your findings for each and every
criterion listed here. Check that there is nothing missing before telling me
that the review is complete.

### Software Engineering

#### DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

- Extract common logic, but only when you have 3+ instances

#### KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid

- Favor clarity over cleverness. Boring code is maintainable code

#### SOLID

- Single responsibility
- Open/closed
- Liskov substitution
- Interface segregation
- Dependency inversion

#### YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It

- Build for today's requirements, not tomorrow's maybes

#### OOP - Object Oriented Programming

- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Prefer combining simple behaviours over complex hierarchies

#### Names matter

- Self-documenting names
- No abbreviations
- Obvious intent
- Searchable across codebase

#### Fail Fast

- Validate inputs early
- crash on invariant violations
- make errors obvious

#### Single-purpose functions

- <20 lines ideal
- 20-50 lines, break up
- > 50 lines refactor or split unless ABSOLUTELY necessary.

#### Idempotency

- Operations should be safely repeatable without side effects

#### Global State

- Minimize global state.
- Where it's necessary, avoid mutable global variables. Use classes or function
  parameters.

### Python

#### PEP Standards

- **PEP 8**: Style Guide for Python Code (layout, naming, formatting)
- **PEP 20**: The Zen of Python (readability, simplicity)
- **PEP 257**: Docstring Conventions
- **PEP 484**: Type Hints

#### Use Built-in Constructs

- List/dictionary comprehensions over manual loops
- Proper use of `enumerate()`, `zip()`, and context managers (`with`)

#### EAFP over LBYL

- _"Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission"_: Use `try/except` for expected errors

#### Use the Standard Library

- `pathlib` instead of manual path handling
- `collections.defaultdict` or `dataclasses` where appropriate

#### Lambda Expressions

- Avoid naming lambdas (use `def` instead)
- Prefer operator module over trivial lambdas
- Use comprehensions over `map`/`filter` with lambda
- Keep lambdas simple and one-line only

#### Declarative Over Imperative

- Dictionary dispatch instead of complex conditionals
- Comprehension filtering over conditional loops
- Ternary expressions for simple assignments
- Pattern matching for complex structures (Python 3.10+)

## Review Output Format

Please structure your review as follows:

### Summary

Brief overview of code quality and adherence to best practices.

### Areas for Improvement

For each departure from best practice, include:

- Detailed description of the departure. Assume the author is reading the review
  and would not have departed from best practice if they were aware of and
  understood it.
- Importance and rationale.
- Impact and potential risks
- Example code from the codebase and a suggestion of how it could be improved.
  Also quote the location (relative file name and line number) for the example
  given.
- Prevalence of the issue. Give a count of how many time it occurs
- References to standards or well-established best practices. Give links to resources
  for the reader to follow where possible.

Present these in order of importance based on the risk, impact and prevalence.

### Appendix

List all locations - file names (relative to the repository root) and line
numbers - for each reported departure.
